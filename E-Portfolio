I have been in the IT field for over 10 years
I am a very fast learner. I know the troubleshooting aspects
For coding that is where I would like to branch off and learn more
Its very interesting on what code can do and how it completes correctly
There are different things that could happen if the code is not written correctly
You will see errors, and the errors will show you what line the code error is on
It can take some time to figure out how the code can be corrected

I am in school at the moment and will be graduating this year to get my bachelors in computer science.
Its very exciting.
I am a team player, as when I am in a team I can make team work happen
Being on the same page with everyone is very important in a team environment. Especially in coding.
Every one will be editing the same code in some aspects. Some people in the team could find an 
error the last tech made that they did not see.

Overtime I am determined to be good in all aspects in IT. Being break fix
troubleshooting. Network installations and troublshooting. Then the most import
Will be coding. I can code the basics. But coding in all aspects is my goal.
